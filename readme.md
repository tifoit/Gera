## Gera Model: Disaster Resource Demand Optimization

**Release v1.0.0**

We are excited to announce the first release of the Gera model, a cutting-edge optimization model designed to dynamically allocate disaster resources based on Graph Neural Networks. This model is a significant step forward in disaster resource management, providing comprehensive decision support for determining the optimal quantity of resources needed during emergencies.

### Key Features

- **Advanced AI Integration**: Leverages the power of artificial intelligence to optimize time-intensive processes and reduce decision biases.
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Utilizes real earthquake disaster data from the past three years for model training, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
- **Open-Source Model**: The model, along with its code and training weights, is open-sourced to foster collaboration and further research in the field.
- **Superior Performance**: Demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, with robust universality and scalability.
- **Plug-and-Play Architecture**: Designed to adapt to various disaster resource prediction algorithms, making it a versatile tool for different scenarios.
